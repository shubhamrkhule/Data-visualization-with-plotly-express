Welcome to this project-based course on Data Visualization with Plotly Express.
In this project, you will create quick and interactive data visualizations with Plotly Express: a high-level data visualization library in Python inspired by Seaborn and ggplot2.
You will explore the various features of the in-built Gapminder dataset, and produce interactive, publication-quality graphs to augment analysis.
